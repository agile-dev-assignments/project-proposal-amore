# Project Proposal

"LINK"

An online random pen-pal website/app that would allow individuals to leave messages for future visitors of the site. Everything would be anonymous but it is possible for the reader to request contact with the writer and if the writer agree as well, contact info can be exchanged, and they will be "linked". Either user could choose to break a link at anytime. Possibility of prioritizing "live" pen-pal's messages.
